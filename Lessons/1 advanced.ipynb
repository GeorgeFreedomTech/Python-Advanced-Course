    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\". It's a way of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled together into individual objects. This is like designing a blueprint for a complex machine (like a robot or a drone) and then building multiple working instances from that single blueprint.\n",

    "- `object`: A specific instance created from a class.\n",
