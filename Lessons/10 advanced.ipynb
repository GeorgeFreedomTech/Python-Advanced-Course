    "# 10. Enumerations (Enum): Predefined States and Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we often deal with variables that should only ever hold one of a few possible, `predefined` values. For example, a mission status might be \"Pending\", \"Active\", or \"Complete\". Using raw strings or numbers for this (\"magic values\") is risky—typos can go unnoticed and the meaning isn't always clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enumerations (Enums)** solve this problem by creating a robust, readable, and type-safe set of `named constants` that are related to each other. Think of an `Enum` as the official command list or set of operational states for a system like a drone or a mission protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using `Enum` from the standard `enum` module, we can create our own custom enumeration types.\n",
    "- They group related named constants into a `single class`.\n",
    "- This makes code more readable, less error-prone, and easier to maintain."
