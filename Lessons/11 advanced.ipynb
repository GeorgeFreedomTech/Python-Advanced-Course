    "# 11. Decorators: Modifying Function Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators are a powerful and widely used feature in Python. They are a way to **modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods** without permanently altering their source code. You can think of a decorator as a \"wrapper\" that you can place around a function to `add functionality` before or after the main function runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is extremely useful for tasks that apply to many different functions, such as `logging`, `timing`, `access control`, or `input validation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new, modified function.\n",
    "- The `@decorator_name` syntax is a clean and \"Pythonic\" shortcut for applying a decorator to a function.\n",
    "- It allows for adding/removing functionality easily."
