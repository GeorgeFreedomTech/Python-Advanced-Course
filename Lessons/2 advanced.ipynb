    "# 2. Encapsulation: Protecting an Object's Internal State\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is a core principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It involves bundling an object's data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (the class). A key part of this is **hiding the object's complex internal workings** and exposing only a controlled, public interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an autonomous space probe. Its complex internal systems — like the flight computer, power core, and sensitive sensor arrays (`private state`) — are protected within a reinforced chassis. Mission Control interacts with the probe only through a secure, well-defined public communication interface (its `public methods`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single Underscore `_attribute` (Protected by Convention):**\n",
    "    - An attribute starting with `_` is still accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "    - However, it signals to other developers: \"This is an internal part. You shouldn't touch this directly unless you know what you're doing.\" It's like a panel labeled **'For Authorized Engineers Only'**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Double Underscore `__attribute` (Private via Name Mangling):**\n",
    "    - An attribute starting with `__` has its name \"mangled\" by Python, making it difficult to access directly from outside. This is as close to \"private\" as Python gets.\n",
    "    - You should only access or modify it through the class's public methods. It's like a **sealed, classified data core** that can only be controlled via its official command interface."
