    "# 3. Getters, Setters, Deleters & @property: Controlled Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "When using encapsulation to hide an object's internal attributes (e.g., `_protected` or `__private`), we need a controlled way to access or modify them from outside the class. This is achieved using special methods known as \"getters\" (to get a value), \"setters\" (to set a new value), and \"deleters\" (to delete an attribute).\n",
    "\n",
    "- These methods allow you to add logic, **validation**, or permission checks before an attribute is read, changed, or deleted.\n",
    "- The `@property` decorator is a \"Pythonic\" way to use these methods as if they were simple attributes, creating a clean and intuitive public interface for your class. This hides the internal complexity, which is a core goal of encapsulation."

    "## 3.1. Summary\n",
    "- The `@property` decorator (and its associated `.setter` and `.deleter`) is primarily used to create a controlled, public interface for **private** attributes.\n",
    "- It allows you to execute validation or other logic when an attribute is accessed, while keeping the syntax for the user of the class clean and simple (e.g., `my_object.attribute = value`).\n",
    "- You don't need to invent different method names like `get_temp()` or `set_temp()`; the getter, setter, and deleter methods are all linked to the same property name (e.g., `temperature`).\n",
    "- While you can create similar methods for public attributes, the `@property` syntax is considered more elegant and \"Pythonic\" for managing controlled access to an object's state."

    "**Task: `Antenna` Calibration with Property Validation**\n",
    "- **Scenario:** You are designing a class to control a deep-space communication `Antenna`. Its horizontal orientation (azimuth) is a critical setting that must be kept within its physical rotation limits.\n",
    "- **Requirements:**\n",
    "    - Create a class named `Antenna`.\n",
    "    - It should have a \"protected\" attribute, e.g., `azimuth`, to store the current angle in degrees.\n",
    "    - Use the `@property` decorator to create an `azimuth` property for getting the attribute's value.\n",
    "    - Create a `setter` for the `azimuth` property. This setter must include **validation** to ensure the new angle is within the valid range of `0` to `360` degrees (inclusive). If the new value is outside this range, print an error message and do not change the `azimuth`.\n",
    "    - Add a standard method `get_status` that `returns` a formatted string, e.g., `\"Antenna pointing at 90.5 degrees azimuth.\"`.\n",
    "- **Testing:**\n",
    "    - Create an instance of `Antenna`.\n",
    "    - Set its initial azimuth to `90` using the property setter.\n",
    "    - Print its status.\n",
    "    - Try to set the azimuth to `400` degrees and verify that an error message is printed and the azimuth remains unchanged.\n",
    "    - Set the azimuth to a valid value like `270` and print the new status to verify the change was successful."
