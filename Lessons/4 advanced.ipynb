    "# 4. Inheritance: Building on Existing Blueprints\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental pillar of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows us to create a new class (the **child** or **subclass**) that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (the **parent** or **superclass**). This promotes code reusability and creates a logical hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this: you have a general blueprint for a `Human`. You can then use that as a basis to create a more specialized blueprint for a `Cyborg`, which has all the properties of a human, plus new cybernetic enhancements. The `Cyborg` *is-a* `Human`, but with added capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheriting** attributes and methods from another class.\n",
    "- The child class can **add its own** new attributes and methods.\n",
    "- The child class can **override or extend** methods from the parent class.\n",
    "- Python also supports **multiple inheritance**, where a class can inherit from more than one parent."
