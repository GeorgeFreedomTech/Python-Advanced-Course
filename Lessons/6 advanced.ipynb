    "# 6. Abstraction: Designing High-Level Blueprints\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is a core programming principle that means focusing on the \"what\" instead of the \"how.\" We create a general concept or interface while hiding the complex underlying details. In Python OOP, this is often achieved by designing **abstract classes** that define a common set of behaviors, but leave the specific implementation of those behaviors to more specialized subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's a way of looking at a problem from a `higher level`, focusing on general ideas rather than specific implementation details.\n",
    "- An abstract class defines a `common interface` (a \"contract\") for its subclasses.\n",

    "- **Unifies the Interface:** An abstract class defines common methods (e.g., `execute()`), allowing different subclasses to be used in the same way.\n",
    "- **Identifies Common Behavior:** It helps define what properties and behaviors are essential to a whole group of related objects.\n",
    "- **Hides Implementation Complexity:** The specific details of *how* a method works are hidden away in the subclasses. Code using these objects doesn't need to worry about the internal details.\n",
