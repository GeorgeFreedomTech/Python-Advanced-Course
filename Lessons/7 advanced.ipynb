    "Just as every complex piece of exploration gear needs a user manual and technical specifications, every well-written piece of Python code needs clear documentation. Good documentation explains what your code does, how to use it, and why it was designed that way. In Python, the primary way to document your code directly is by using **docstrings**.\n",

    "- A docstring should be created for:\n",
    "    - Every public `module` (at the very top of the `.py` file).\n",
    "    - Every public `class`.\n",
    "    - Every public `method` (function within a class).\n",
    "- By convention, a docstring is a string literal that occurs as the **first statement** within the object it documents, enclosed in triple quotes `\"\"\"...\"\"\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Docstrings are used by the `help()` function and the `pydoc` module.\n",
    "- For a quick overview we can use `dir()` function to see all the methods and attributes of an object."
