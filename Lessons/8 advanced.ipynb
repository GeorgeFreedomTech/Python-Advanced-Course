    "# 8. Dunder Methods: Customizing Core Object Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Dunder methods (short for **d**ouble **under**score methods) are special, predefined methods in Python, recognizable by the double underscores surrounding their names (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`). They are also sometimes called \"magic methods.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods allow you to define how your custom objects interact with Python's built-in operations and functions. They are called automatically by the interpreter in specific contexts, such as when you use operators (`+`, `==`), call functions (`len()`, `print()`), or access attributes. By overriding these methods, you can customize the core behavior of your objects â€“ it's like programming the fundamental physics of how they exist and interact in your code."
