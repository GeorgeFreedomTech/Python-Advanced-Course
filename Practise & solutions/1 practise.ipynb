    "- Create a class named `Operative`.\n",
    "- The constructor should accept and set up the following attributes for each operative: `callsign` (string), `clearance_level` (integer), `specialization` (string), and `contact_channel` (string).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Testing and Verification:**\n",
    "- Create two different **instances** of your `Operative` class with different attribute values (e.g., one for a scientist, one for an engineer).\n",
    "- Using the `print()` function, display a specific **attribute** (e.g., the `specialization`) for both instances to verify they hold unique data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Challenge: Target List Check:**\n",
    "- Create a list of strings named `priority_target_list`, e.g., `[\"Helios\", \"Vesper\", \"Orion\"]`.\n",
    "- Check if the `callsign` attribute of each of your created operative instances is present `in` this list.\n",
    "- If an operative's callsign is on the list, print a message like: `\"Alert: Priority target 'Helios' detected.\"`\n",
    "- If it's not on the list, print a message like: `\"Operative 'Raptor' is not on the priority list.\"`"

    "\n",
    "**2. Create Basic Methods:**\n",
    "- Create a method `report_status` that prints a message introducing the assistant by its name and current location.\n",
    "- Create a method `relocate` that updates the assistant's `current_location` attribute.\n",
    "- Create a method `learn_protocol` that adds a new protocol (a string) to the assistant's `known_protocols` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Challenge I: Interaction Method:**\n",
    "- Create a method `compare_skills` that allows an instance to interact with another instance of the `LabAssistant` class.\n",
    "- When called, both assistants should report how many protocols they know.\n",
    "- *Example Output:*\n",
    "  `\"Robot RX-1 knows 3 protocols.\"`\n",
    "  `\"Robot Z-5 knows 5 protocols.\"`\n",
    "  \n",
    "**4. Challenge II: Extended Interaction:**\n",
    "- Extend the `compare_skills` method from the previous challenge.\n",
    "- After reporting the number of protocols each assistant knows, the method should add a line that compares them and prints which one is more \"experienced\" (has more protocols).\n",

    "## Solutions\n",
    "- **Try First:** Only look at the solutions after you have tried solving the exercises `using your own effort` and are truly stuck.\n",
    "- **Multiple Solutions Exist:** `There are usually multiple ways to solve a task.` The code provided is just one possible approach.\n",
    "- **Focus on the Concept:** Please note that the code in these solutions is **intentionally simplified** to focus purely on the **currently discussed topic**. To maintain clarity and avoid distraction, the code often omits production-level features like comprehensive error handling (`try-except` blocks), type hints or full documentation (`docstrings`). The primary goal is to illustrate the core concept being taught, not to present production-quality code."
