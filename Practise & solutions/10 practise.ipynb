    "- **Try First:** Only look at the solutions after you have tried solving the exercises `using your own effort` and are truly stuck.\n",
    "- **Multiple Solutions Exist:** `There are usually multiple ways to solve a task.` The code provided is just one possible approach.\n",
    "- **Focus on the Concept:** Please note that the code in these solutions is **intentionally simplified** to focus purely on the **currently discussed topic**. To maintain clarity and avoid distraction, the code often omits production-level features like comprehensive error handling (`try-except` blocks), type hints or full documentation (`docstrings`). The primary goal is to illustrate the core concept being taught, not to present production-quality code."
