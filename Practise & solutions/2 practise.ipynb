    "**1. `PowerCore` Management**\n",
    "- **Scenario:** Design a class to manage the energy level of a spaceship's `PowerCore`.\n",
    "- **Requirements:**\n",
    "    - Create a class named `PowerCore`.\n",
    "    - It should have a **private attribute** (e.g., `energy_level`) to store the current energy level.\n",
    "    - The constructor (`__init__`) should accept an `initial_charge` and set the balance.\n",
    "    - A method `recharge` that adds the given `amount` to the energy balance.\n",
    "    - A method `draw_power` that subtracts the `amount`, but only if there is sufficient energy. If not, it should print a warning like \"Insufficient power! Cannot draw requested amount.\"\n",
    "    - A method `get_balance` that `returns` the current energy balance, providing controlled read-access to the private attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing:**\n",
    "    - Create an instance of `PowerCore` with an initial charge of `1000` units.\n",
    "    - Call the `recharge` method to add `500` units.\n",
    "    - Call the `draw_power` method to subtract `200` units.\n",
    "    - Call `get_balance` and print the result to verify it is `1300`.\n",
    "    - Try to draw `1500` units of power and verify that the warning message is printed and the balance remains `1300`.\n",

    "**2. `PhysicsParticle` Simulation**\n",
    "- **Scenario:** Simulate a particle in a physics experiment chamber.\n",
    "- **Requirements:**\n",
    "    - A class named `PhysicsParticle`.\n",
    "    - A **private attribute** `velocity` to store the particle's current velocity. The initial velocity should default to `0` in the constructor.\n",
    "    - A method `apply_force`: Increases the particle's velocity by the given `force_amount`. Add a condition so this only happens if `force_amount` is a positive number; otherwise, print an error message.\n",
    "    - A method `apply_resistance`: Decreases the particle's velocity by the given `resistance_amount`. Add a condition so that the velocity cannot drop below 0. If a resistance amount would result in a negative velocity, the velocity should be set to 0 instead.\n",
    "    - A method `get_velocity`: `return`s the current value of the private `velocity` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing:**\n",
    "    - Create an instance of the `PhysicsParticle` class.\n",
    "    - Apply a force of 30 and display the velocity (should be 30).\n",
    "    - Apply resistance of 10 and display the velocity (should be 20).\n",
    "    - Apply resistance of 50 and display the velocity (should be 0).\n",
    "    - Try to apply a negative force and check for the error message.\n",

    "**3. `SimulationControl` Access**\n",
    "- **Scenario:** Manage access to a high-security physics simulation with a username and access key.\n",
    "- **Requirements:**\n",
    "    - A class named `SimulationControl`.\n",
    "    - A **public attribute** `username`.\n",
    "    - A **private attribute** `access_key`.\n",
    "    - The constructor should set both the `username` and the initial `__access_key`.\n",
    "    - A public method `change_access_key` that allows a user to change their key. It should only succeed if the provided `old_key_attempt` matches the current `access_key`.\n",
    "    - A **private method** `verify_key` that returns `True` if the attempt matches the stored `access_key`, and `False` otherwise. This private method must be used inside the `change_access_key` method to perform the validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing:**\n",
    "    - Create an instance for a user.\n",
    "    * Try to change the access key with the wrong old key and verify it fails (e.g., it prints an error message and the key remains unchanged).\n",
    "    * Change the access key using the correct old key and verify it succeeds."

    "## Solutions\n",
    "- **Try First:** Only look at the solutions after you have tried solving the exercises `using your own effort` and are truly stuck.\n",
    "- **Multiple Solutions Exist:** `There are usually multiple ways to solve a task.` The code provided is just one possible approach.\n",
    "- **Focus on the Concept:** Please note that the code in these solutions is **intentionally simplified** to focus purely on the **currently discussed topic**. To maintain clarity and avoid distraction, the code often omits production-level features like comprehensive error handling (`try-except` blocks), type hints or full documentation (`docstrings`). The primary goal is to illustrate the core concept being taught, not to present production-quality code."
