    "**Task: `Antenna` Calibration with Property Validation**\n",
    "- **Scenario:** You are designing a class to control a deep-space communication `Antenna`. Its horizontal orientation (azimuth) is a critical setting that must be kept within its physical rotation limits.\n",
    "- **Requirements:**\n",
    "    - Create a class named `Antenna`.\n",
    "    - It should have a \"protected\" attribute, e.g., `azimuth`, to store the current angle in degrees.\n",
    "    - Use the `@property` decorator to create an `azimuth` property for getting the attribute's value.\n",
    "    - Create a `setter` for the `azimuth` property. This setter must include **validation** to ensure the new angle is within the valid range of `0` to `360` degrees (inclusive). If the new value is outside this range, print an error message and do not change the `azimuth`.\n",
    "    - Add a standard method `get_status` that `returns` a formatted string, e.g., `\"Antenna pointing at 90.5 degrees azimuth.\"`.\n",
    "- **Testing:**\n",
    "    - Create an instance of `Antenna`.\n",
    "    - Set its initial azimuth to `90` using the property setter.\n",
    "    - Print its status.\n",
    "    - Try to set the azimuth to `400` degrees and verify that an error message is printed and the azimuth remains unchanged.\n",
    "    - Set the azimuth to a valid value like `270` and print the new status to verify the change was successful."

    "## Solutions\n",
    "- **Try First:** Only look at the solutions after you have tried solving the exercises `using your own effort` and are truly stuck.\n",
    "- **Multiple Solutions Exist:** `There are usually multiple ways to solve a task.` The code provided is just one possible approach.\n",
    "- **Focus on the Concept:** Please note that the code in these solutions is **intentionally simplified** to focus purely on the **currently discussed topic**. To maintain clarity and avoid distraction, the code often omits production-level features like comprehensive error handling (`try-except` blocks), type hints or full documentation (`docstrings`). The primary goal is to illustrate the core concept being taught, not to present production-quality code."
