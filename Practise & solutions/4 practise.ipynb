    "**Task: `CrewMember` Hierarchy**\n",
    "- **Scenario:** You are building a system to manage crew on an exploration starship. You need to model different roles, which share common human traits but also have specialized responsibilities and data.\n",
    "- **Part 1: Parent and Child**\n",
    "    - Start with a base class `CrewMember` that has attributes like `name` and `id_number`.\n",
    "    - Create a child class `Engineer` that inherits from `CrewMember`. An engineer should have an additional attribute: `specialization` (e.g., \"Warp Core\", \"Life Support\").\n",
    "    - Add a method to the `Engineer` class to display their specialization.\n",
    "- **Part 2: Challenge (Grandchild Class)**\n",
    "    - Create a class `ChiefEngineer` that inherits from `Engineer`. This class should have an additional attribute: `team_members`.\n",
    "    - Add a method to `ChiefEngineer` called `add_team_member` that allows adding `Engineer` objects to the `team_members` list.\n",
    "    - Add a constraint to this method: a `ChiefEngineer` can have a maximum of **5** direct subordinates. If you try to add more, it should print a warning message like `\"Maximum team size reached. Cannot add more members.\"` and not add the engineer.\n",
    "- **Testing:**\n",
    "    - Create a `ChiefEngineer` instance.\n",
    "    - Create several `Engineer` instances.\n",
    "    - Use the `add_team_member` method to add them to the chief's team.\n",
    "    - Test the limit by trying to add a 6th engineer and verify the warning is printed."

    "## Solutions\n",
    "- **Try First:** Only look at the solutions after you have tried solving the exercises `using your own effort` and are truly stuck.\n",
    "- **Multiple Solutions Exist:** `There are usually multiple ways to solve a task.` The code provided is just one possible approach.\n",
    "- **Focus on the Concept:** Please note that the code in these solutions is **intentionally simplified** to focus purely on the **currently discussed topic**. To maintain clarity and avoid distraction, the code often omits production-level features like comprehensive error handling (`try-except` blocks), type hints or full documentation (`docstrings`). The primary goal is to illustrate the core concept being taught, not to present production-quality code."
