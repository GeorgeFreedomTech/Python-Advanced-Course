    "**Task: `PlanetaryProbe` Specialization**\n",
    "- **Scenario:** You are designing a system to manage different types of planetary probes for an exploration mission. All probes share some common actions but perform them differently based on their design.\n",
    "- **Requirements:**\n",
    "    - Create a base (parent) class named `PlanetaryProbe` with two methods:\n",
    "        - `traverse`: This method should print a generic message like `\"Probe is moving across terrain.\"`\n",
    "        - `emit_signal`: This method should print a generic message like `\"Emitting standard data pulse.\"`\n",
    "    - Create three child classes that inherit from `PlanetaryProbe`: `WheeledProbe`, `WalkingProbe`, and `FlyingProbe`.\n",
    "    - In each of the three child classes, **override** both the `traverse` and `emit_signal` methods to provide a specific implementation that fits the probe type.\n",
    "        - For example, `WheeledProbe` could print `\"Rolling across terrain...\"`, while `FlyingProbe` prints `\"Flying over terrain...\"`.\n",
    "        - Similarly, `WalkingProbe` could print `\"Sending seismic vibration data.\"`, while `FlyingProbe` prints `\"Sending high-resolution aerial scan data.\"`.\n",
    "- **Testing:**\n",
    "    - Create one instance of each of your specialized probe classes (`WheeledProbe`, `WalkingProbe`, `FlyingProbe`).\n",
    "    - Call the `traverse` and `emit_signal` methods on each probe. Observe how each object executes its own version of the method."

    "## Solutions\n",
    "- **Try First:** Only look at the solutions after you have tried solving the exercises `using your own effort` and are truly stuck.\n",
    "- **Multiple Solutions Exist:** `There are usually multiple ways to solve a task.` The code provided is just one possible approach.\n",
    "- **Focus on the Concept:** Please note that the code in these solutions is **intentionally simplified** to focus purely on the **currently discussed topic**. To maintain clarity and avoid distraction, the code often omits production-level features like comprehensive error handling (`try-except` blocks), type hints or full documentation (`docstrings`). The primary goal is to illustrate the core concept being taught, not to present production-quality code."
