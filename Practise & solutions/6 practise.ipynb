    "**Task: Abstract Spaceship Blueprint**\n",
    "- Using the `abc` module, create an **abstract base class** named `Spaceship`.\n",
    "- This class should have attributes for `name` and `tonnage` (set in the constructor).\n",
    "- It should also define three (empty) **abstract methods**: `move`, `attack`, and `defend`.\n",
    "- Then, create at least two concrete child classes that inherit from `Spaceship`, for example, `Battleship` and `Scoutship`.\n",
    "- In each child class, provide a specific implementation (e.g., a `print` statement) for the inherited abstract methods (`move`, `attack`, `defend`). The implementation for each ship type should be different, but the method names must be the same as in the parent.\n",
    "- **Challenge:**\n",
    "    - Create another child class, `CargoHauler`, that also inherits from `Spaceship`.\n",
    "    - In this new class, implement the `move` and `defend` methods.\n",
    "    - For the `attack` method, `raise` a `NotImplementedError` with a message like \"Cargo haulers are not equipped for combat.\"\n",
    "- **Testing:**\n",
    "    - Create an instance of `Battleship` and `Scoutship`.\n",
    "    - Create a list containing both instances.\n",
    "    - Call the `move` method on each ship to demonstrate polymorphism.\n",
    "    - Create an instance of your `CargoHauler` and call its `attack` method using error handling to catch the `NotImplementedError`."

    "## Solutions\n",
    "- **Try First:** Only look at the solutions after you have tried solving the exercises `using your own effort` and are truly stuck.\n",
    "- **Multiple Solutions Exist:** `There are usually multiple ways to solve a task.` The code provided is just one possible approach.\n",
    "- **Focus on the Concept:** Please note that the code in these solutions is **intentionally simplified** to focus purely on the **currently discussed topic**. To maintain clarity and avoid distraction, the code often omits production-level features like comprehensive error handling (`try-except` blocks), type hints or full documentation (`docstrings`). The primary goal is to illustrate the core concept being taught, not to present production-quality code."
