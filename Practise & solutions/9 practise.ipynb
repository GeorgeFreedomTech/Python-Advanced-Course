    "**Task: Autonomous Drone Fleet Management**\n",
    "- **Scenario:** You are tasked with managing the production and registry of a fleet of autonomous drones for various missions.\n",
    "- **Requirements:**\n",
    "    - Create a class named `AutonomousDrone`. It should have instance attributes for `drone_id`, `model`, and `max_speed`.\n",
    "    - Keep a running count of the total number of drones manufactured. The count should increment each time a new instance is created.\n",
    "    - Create a **class method** that returns this total count.\n",
    "- **Testing:**\n",
    "    - Create 3 different drone instances.\n",
    "    - Call your class method to print the total count and verify it is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Challenge I: Instance Registry & Reporting**\n",
    "- **Requirements:**\n",
    "    - Extend your `AutonomousDrone` class.\n",
    "    - Add another **class variable** to act as a registry that stores every drone instance upon creation.\n",
    "    - When you use a print() on an class instance return a user-friendly string summary of a drone's details (e.g., `\"Drone [ID: X-01, Model: Scout, Speed: 120 kph]\"`).\n",
    "    - Create a **class method** goes through all manufactured drones and prints the details of only those whose `max_speed` is greater than the `speed_limit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Challenge II: Drone Factory**\n",
    "- **Requirements:**\n",
    "    - Refactor your `AutonomousDrone` class to act as a \"factory\" for standard models.\n",
    "    - Using **class methods** as alternative constructors, create two factory methods:\n",
    "        - `create_scout_drone`: This method should create and return an `AutonomousDrone` instance with pre-filled parameters: `model=\"ReconScout\"` and `max_speed=120`.\n",
    "        - `create_cargo_drone`: This method should create and return an `AutonomousDrone` instance with pre-filled parameters: `model=\"CargoLifter\"` and `max_speed=75`.\n",
    "- **Testing:**\n",
    "    - Use your new factory methods to create one scout drone and one cargo drone.\n",
    "    - Print the objects to verify their attributes."

    "## Solutions\n",
    "- **Try First:** Only look at the solutions after you have tried solving the exercises `using your own effort` and are truly stuck.\n",
    "- **Multiple Solutions Exist:** `There are usually multiple ways to solve a task.` The code provided is just one possible approach.\n",
    "- **Focus on the Concept:** Please note that the code in these solutions is **intentionally simplified** to focus purely on the **currently discussed topic**. To maintain clarity and avoid distraction, the code often omits production-level features like comprehensive error handling (`try-except` blocks), type hints or full documentation (`docstrings`). The primary goal is to illustrate the core concept being taught, not to present production-quality code."
