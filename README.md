# Python Advanced Course - Object-Oriented Design & Principles

By **George Freedom Tech** (George Freedom - Tech Educator & Strategic Mentor)

Move beyond simple scripts and learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. This advanced course (Lessons 1-12) dives deep into the principles of classes, inheritance, and abstraction, preparing you to architect sophisticated software solutions.

## üöÄ Welcome to the Architect's Workshop!
This repository hosts **"Python Advanced: Mastering OOP for Scalable Software"** ‚Äì a comprehensive course presented in Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts.

This course is for learners who have mastered Python's fundamentals and intermediate techniques. You are now ready to stop just *writing* code and start *designing* it. We will explore the mindset and tools necessary to build clean, reusable, and maintainable software systems.

## üó∫Ô∏è Course Outline / Your Architectural Blueprint:

This advanced curriculum is structured into modules focusing on the core tenets of professional software design.

* **Lesson 1: Introduction to OOP** - The foundational shift from writing scripts to designing self-contained, autonomous entities (objects).
* **Lesson 2: Encapsulation** - Securing the core systems of your objects and creating clean, public command interfaces.
* **Lesson 3: Getters, Setters & @property** - Building the precise dials, levers, and readouts for your objects, with built-in validation.
* **Lesson 4: Inheritance** - Creating specialized units by inheriting and extending core designs.
* **Lesson 5: Polymorphism** - Issuing a single command to a diverse squad of objects and having each respond in its own unique way.
* **Lesson 6: Abstraction** - Designing abstract blueprints that define a contract of required capabilities without dictating the implementation.
* **Lesson 7: Documentation in OOP** - Writing the professional technical manuals and operational guides (`docstrings`) for your classes and modules.
* **Lesson 8: Dunder Methods** - Rewiring the fundamental "physics" of your objects to define how they interact with Python's native operators (`+`, `==`, `len()`, etc.).
* **Lesson 9: Static variables, constants, methods and classmethods** - Managing data and behaviors that belong to the class blueprint itself.
* **Lesson 10: Enumerations** - Creating a fixed set of commands, states, or identifiers to prevent errors and improve code clarity.
* **Lesson 11: Decorators** - Wrapping your functions and methods in "protocol layers" for logging, validation, or performance monitoring.
* **Lesson 12: New Horizons & Next Steps** - How to succeed in IT world, how to navigate there and what to take into a backpack for the expedition.
    
## üéØ Learning Objectives / Blueprints to Master:

Upon completing this expedition, you will be able to:

* Think and design solutions in an Object-Oriented way.
* Build your own custom classes with well-defined attributes, properties, and methods.
* Master core OOP principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
* Use advanced features like properties, static/class methods, and dunder methods to create elegant APIs for your classes.
* Write cleaner, more modular, reusable, and scalable Python code suitable for complex projects.
* Apply basic software design patterns to structure your applications professionally.
    
## üéí Prerequisites / Advanced Gear-Up:

* A solid understanding of Python topics covered in the **[Python Foundations](https://github.com/GeorgeFreedomTech/python-foundations-course)** and **[Python Intermediate](https://github.com/GeorgeFreedomTech/python-intermediate-course)** courses or equivalent experience.
* This includes undestanding of data structures, loops, functions, file I/O, virtual environments, and using external libraries.
* An interest in moving beyond simple scripting towards software design and architecture.

## üß≠ How to Use These Materials:
    
The lessons are provided as Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) and standard Python (`.py`) files. To use them:

0.  **Online:** For a quick look at `.ipynb` files, you can use online viewers or services like [JupyterLite](https://jupyter.org/try) by uploading the files.

-- OR--

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get a copy of this repository onto your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GeorgeFreedomTech/python-advanced-course.git
    ```
2.  **Set Up Virtual Environment:** It is critical for advanced projects to use a dedicated virtual environment.
    ```bash
    # Navigate into the project folder
    cd python-advanced-course
    # Create and activate the environment
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:** If a lesson requires external packages, install them into your active environment using the provided `requirements.txt` file (if applicable).
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Launch Jupyter & Explore:** Run `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` from your activated terminal and navigate to the lesson files. Each lesson includes explanations, code examples, and exercises, with corresponding "Solutions" provided.

## üí° Purpose of This Repository:

* **Educational Resource:** A practical, hands-on guide for taking your Python skills to a professional, object-oriented level.
* **Professional Portfolio:** Demonstrating my teaching methodology for advanced software design concepts.
* **Content Foundation:** A source of examples for articles, tutorials, and social media.
