# Python Advanced Course - Object-Oriented Design & Principles

By **George Freedom**

Move beyond simple scripts and learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. This advanced course (Lessons 1-12) dives deep into the principles of classes, inheritance, and abstraction, preparing you to architect sophisticated software solutions.

## 🚀 Welcome to the Architect's Workshop!
This repository hosts **"Python Advanced: Mastering OOP for Scalable Software"** – a comprehensive course presented in Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts.

This course is for learners who have mastered Python's fundamentals and intermediate techniques. You are now ready to stop just *writing* code and start *designing* it. We will explore the mindset and tools necessary to build clean, reusable, and maintainable software systems.

## 🗺️ Course Outline / Your Architectural Blueprint:

This advanced curriculum is structured into modules focusing on the core tenets of professional software design.

* **Lesson 1: Introduction to OOP** - The foundational shift from writing scripts to designing self-contained, autonomous entities (objects).
* **Lesson 2: Encapsulation** - Securing the core systems of your objects and creating clean, public command interfaces.
* **Lesson 3: Getters, Setters & @property** - Building the precise dials, levers, and readouts for your objects, with built-in validation.
* **Lesson 4: Inheritance** - Creating specialized units by inheriting and extending core designs.
* **Lesson 5: Polymorphism** - Issuing a single command to a diverse squad of objects and having each respond in its own unique way.
* **Lesson 6: Abstraction** - Designing abstract blueprints that define a contract of required capabilities without dictating the implementation.
* **Lesson 7: Documentation in OOP** - Writing the professional technical manuals and operational guides (`docstrings`) for your classes and modules.
* **Lesson 8: Dunder Methods** - Rewiring the fundamental "physics" of your objects to define how they interact with Python's native operators (`+`, `==`, `len()`, etc.).
* **Lesson 9: Static variables, constants, methods and classmethods** - Managing data and behaviors that belong to the class blueprint itself.
* **Lesson 10: Enumerations** - Creating a fixed set of commands, states, or identifiers to prevent errors and improve code clarity.
* **Lesson 11: Decorators** - Wrapping your functions and methods in "protocol layers" for logging, validation, or performance monitoring.
* **Lesson 12: New Horizons & Roadmaps** - How to succeed in IT world, how to navigate there and what to take into a backpack for the expedition.
    
## 🎯 Learning Objectives / Blueprints to Master:

Upon completing this expedition, you will be able to:

* Think and design solutions in an Object-Oriented way.
* Build your own custom classes with well-defined attributes, properties, and methods.
* Master core OOP principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
* Use advanced features like properties, static/class methods, and dunder methods to create elegant APIs for your classes.
* Write cleaner, more modular, reusable, and scalable Python code suitable for complex projects.
* Apply basic software design patterns to structure your applications professionally.
    
## 🎒 Prerequisites / Advanced Gear-Up:

* A solid understanding of Python topics covered in the **[Python Foundations Course](https://github.com/GeorgeFreedomTech/python-foundations-course)** and **[Python Intermediate Course](https://github.com/GeorgeFreedomTech/python-intermediate-course)** courses or equivalent experience.
* This includes undestanding of data structures, loops, functions, file I/O, virtual environments, and using external libraries.
* An interest in moving beyond simple scripting towards software design and architecture.

## 🧭  How to Get and Run Course Materials:
    
Here is a guide on how to download the Jupyter Notebooks (**.ipynb files**) and how to open them. You can choose to work locally (on your computer) or online.

### Part 1: How to Download the Materials

#### Option A: Download as ZIP (Easiest for Beginners)
* Go to the main page of this repository on GitHub.
* Click the green Code button.
* Select **Download ZIP**.
Important: Extract (unzip) the downloaded folder to a location on your computer (e.g., Documents/PythonCourse). Do not try to run files directly inside the ZIP archive.

#### Option B: Git Clone (For Advanced Users)
If you are comfortable with the terminal and want to easily update materials later:
* Open your terminal or command prompt.
* Run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GeorgeFreedomTech/python-advanced-course.git
    ```
### Part 2: How to Open and Run the Notebooks
#### Option 1: VS Code (Recommended - Offline)
This is the best way to work if you want to keep everything on your own computer.

**Prerequisites:**
* VS Code installed.
* Python installed.
* Jupyter Extension for VS Code installed (search for "Jupyter" by Microsoft in the Extensions marketplace).

**Steps:**
1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to File > Open Folder... and select the folder you downloaded/cloned.
3. Click on any file ending in **.ipynb**.
4. In the top-right corner, click Select Kernel and choose your Python version (or venv).
5. You can now run the code cells by clicking the "Play" button next to them.

#### Option 2: Google Colab (Alternative - Online)
If you cannot install Python locally or want to try the code quickly in your browser.

**Prerequisites:**
* You have to have a Google account
  
**Steps:**
1. Go to **colab.research.google.com**.
2. Log in with your **Google Account**.
3. Select the **GitHub tab** in the pop-up window.
4. Paste the URL of this repository and search.
5. Click on the notebook you want to open.
* **Alternatively:** You can go to the Upload tab and upload the **.ipynb file** you downloaded in Part 1.

## 💡 Purpose of This Repository:
