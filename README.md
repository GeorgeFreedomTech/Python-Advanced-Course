# Python Advanced Course - Object-Oriented Design & Principles

By **George Freedom Tech** (George Freedom - Tech Educator & Strategic Mentor)

Move beyond simple scripts and learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. This advanced course (Lessons 1-12) dives deep into the principles of classes, inheritance, and abstraction, preparing you to architect sophisticated software solutions.

## üöÄ Welcome to the Architect's Workshop!
This repository hosts **"Python Advanced: Mastering OOP for Scalable Software"** ‚Äì a comprehensive course presented in Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts.

This course is for learners who have mastered Python's fundamentals and intermediate techniques. You are now ready to stop just *writing* code and start *designing* it. We will explore the mindset and tools necessary to build clean, reusable, and maintainable software systems.

## üó∫Ô∏è Course Outline / Your Architectural Blueprint:

This advanced curriculum is structured into modules focusing on the core tenets of professional software design.

* **Lesson 1: Introduction to OOP** - The foundational shift from writing scripts to designing self-contained, autonomous entities (objects).
* **Lesson 2: Encapsulation** - Securing the core systems of your objects and creating clean, public command interfaces.
* **Lesson 3: Getters, Setters & @property** - Building the precise dials, levers, and readouts for your objects, with built-in validation.
* **Lesson 4: Inheritance** - Creating specialized units by inheriting and extending core designs.
* **Lesson 5: Polymorphism** - Issuing a single command to a diverse squad of objects and having each respond in its own unique way.
* **Lesson 6: Abstraction** - Designing abstract blueprints that define a contract of required capabilities without dictating the implementation.
* **Lesson 7: Documentation in OOP** - Writing the professional technical manuals and operational guides (`docstrings`) for your classes and modules.
* **Lesson 8: Dunder Methods** - Rewiring the fundamental "physics" of your objects to define how they interact with Python's native operators (`+`, `==`, `len()`, etc.).
* **Lesson 9: Static variables, constants, methods and classmethods** - Managing data and behaviors that belong to the class blueprint itself.
* **Lesson 10: Enumerations** - Creating a fixed set of commands, states, or identifiers to prevent errors and improve code clarity.
* **Lesson 11: Decorators** - Wrapping your functions and methods in "protocol layers" for logging, validation, or performance monitoring.
* **Lesson 12: New Horizons & Next Steps** - How to succeed in IT world, how to navigate there and what to take into a backpack for the expedition.
    
## üéØ Learning Objectives / Blueprints to Master:

Upon completing this expedition, you will be able to:

* Think and design solutions in an Object-Oriented way.
* Build your own custom classes with well-defined attributes, properties, and methods.
* Master core OOP principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
* Use advanced features like properties, static/class methods, and dunder methods to create elegant APIs for your classes.
* Write cleaner, more modular, reusable, and scalable Python code suitable for complex projects.
* Apply basic software design patterns to structure your applications professionally.
    
## üéí Prerequisites / Advanced Gear-Up:

* A solid understanding of Python topics covered in the **[Python Foundations Course](https://github.com/GeorgeFreedomTech/python-foundations-course)** and **[Python Intermediate Course](https://github.com/GeorgeFreedomTech/python-intermediate-course)** courses or equivalent experience.
* This includes undestanding of data structures, loops, functions, file I/O, virtual environments, and using external libraries.
* An interest in moving beyond simple scripting towards software design and architecture.

## üß≠ How to Use These Materials:
    
The lessons are provided as Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files. To use them:

0. **Online:** Download the Jupyter files and go on: https://jupyter.org/try .. and upload&open the files there

-- OR--

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get a copy of this repository onto your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GeorgeFreedomTech/python-foundations-course.git
    ```
2.  **Ensure Jupyter is Installed:** You'll need Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    * The common way is to install the Anaconda Distribution (which includes Jupyter).
    * Alternatively, install it via pip:
        ```bash
        pip install notebook
        # or for JupyterLab
        pip install jupyterlab
        ```
3.  **Launch Jupyter:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you cloned/downloaded the files, and run:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    or for JupyterLab:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
4.  **Explore:** Your browser should open the Jupyter interface. Navigate to the lesson files and open them to start your learning expedition! Each lesson notebook contains explanations, code examples, and exercises. A corresponding "Solutions" notebook is provided for the exercises.

## üí° Purpose of This Repository:
